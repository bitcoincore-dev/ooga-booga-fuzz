# rename_rust_secp_symbols.sh - Rename the vendored libsecp256k1 symbols in a Rust
# module archive to avoid duplicate symbol conflicts when linking multiple Rust
# modules together.
#
# Usage: rename_rust_secp_symbols.sh <archive> <prefix>
#
# Rust crates depending on secp256k1-sys statically embed their own copy of
# libsecp256k1. Its C symbols are namespaced by the crate version rather than by
# the consuming crate, e.g. secp256k1-sys 0.10.1 exports
# rustsecp256k1_v0_10_0_context_create. Two modules that pin the same
# secp256k1-sys version therefore export byte-identical symbols, and linking both
# into one binary fails with "multiple definition".
#
# This script renames every rustsecp256k1_* symbol to PREFIX_<original_name>
# using objcopy --redefine-syms. Both the definitions and all references to them
# are rewritten, so each module keeps a self-contained copy of libsecp256k1 under
# its own namespace.
#
# Requires: nm, objcopy (override with the OBJCOPY environment variable), ranlib
